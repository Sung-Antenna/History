[Hand held devices, Asset trackers] 
1. PCB layout check and recommedation the best antennas positions - LTE, BT, Wi-Fi and GPS/GNSS. with possible risk check.
2. Recommendation for the possible embedded antennas first.
3. If necessary, suggest customized antennas.
4. Simple Gerber/Step file check & transimission line check are also possible.
